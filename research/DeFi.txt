AMM: Automatic Makret Maker
An automated market maker (AMM) is a type of decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol that 
relies on a mathematical formula to price assets. Instead of using an order book like a 
traditional exchange, assets are priced according to a pricing algorithm.
This formula can vary with each protocol. For example, Uniswap uses x * y = k, where x is 
the amount of one token in the liquidity pool, and y is the amount of the other. In this 
formula, k is a fixed constant, meaning the poolâ€™s total liquidity always has to remain the same.
